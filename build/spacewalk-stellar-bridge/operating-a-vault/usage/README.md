# Usage

## The _Portal_

The portal is a web interface for interacting with the Pendulum and Amplitude parachains. You can find it [here](https://portal.pendulumchain.org/pendulum/dashboard).

If you want to use the portal for testing on a local chain, you need to use [this](https://portal.pendulumchain.org/foucoco/dashboard) URL.
{% endhint %}

We recommend using the portal if you are not comfortable with operating a wallet, as it will guide you through the various operations that the vault offers



### Operating the Vault

As of writing, the vault offers two main operations, the Issue, and Redeem functionalities.&#x20;

The examples provided use the Amplitude canary network, you will be able to operate in the same way with both a testnet, Foucoco, or Pendulum.
