# FAQ

**What is Pendulum?**

Pendulum is an open-source blockchain that aims to establish the missing link between the fiat and the DeFi ecosystems through a fiat-optimized smart contract blockchain Pendulum is built with Substrate and will allow connecting DeFi applications to the foreign exchange market, building automated market makers (AMMs) to introduce scalable liquidity pools for fiat currencies, and create yield earning opportunities for fiat token holders.

**What is Amplitude?**&#x20;

[Amplitude ](https://pendulumchain.org/amplitude)is the canary network on Kusama of its sister blockchain, Pendulum. Amplitude & Pendulum aim to build the missing link between fiat and DeFi through a fiat-optimized smart contract blockchain. Amplitude will act as a testing ground for applications & network parameters for Pendulum and be powered by the native AMPE token. The successful parachain auction raised more than 24,080 KSM (approximately $1,172,930) means Amplitude now has a live Kusama parachain slot.\

**Is there a possibility to use XLM for gas fees on Pendulum & Amplitude?**

TX fees will be settled in Pendulums and Amplitudes native token PEN & AMPE, however, we are exploring accepting other tokens to settle transaction fees as well.

**What is Spacewalk?**&#x20;

[Spacewalk ](https://medium.com/pendulum-chain/introducing-spacewalk-the-trust-minimized-bridge-between-stellar-and-pendulum-68ddbe7349a0)is a framework for trust-minimized and decentralized bridges. It enables Polkadot parachains to connect to various blockchains in a unified manner. Spacewalk solves multiple challenges that bridge builders encounter, such as connecting to chains that donâ€™t support smart contracts or SPV. As an example we present a bridge to Stellar that supports multiple assets and stable coins and share our concept for bridging to other ecosystems like Celo or Solana.

**What is a Polkadot parachain and how does this relate to Pendulum?**&#x20;

Polkadot is a layer zero network of connected blockchains that we call parachains. Polkadot offers parachains security and interoperability between each other and the many different blockchains in the cryptoverse. Polkadot hosts [crowdloans and auctions](https://medium.com/pendulum-chain/parachain-auctions-and-crowdloans-on-polkadot-kusama-a-quick-overview-2e4892a0ec90) for new parachains to join the network.&#x20;
