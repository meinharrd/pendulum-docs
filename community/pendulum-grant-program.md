# Pendulum Grant Program

On our mission to build the fiat DeFi future, the release of the [Pendulum Grants Program](https://medium.com/pendulum-chain/pendulum-launches-ecosystem-grant-program-c193237305ce) will offer support for projects building out the internet of fiat ecosystem and infrastructure. Anyone can apply for a grant including individuals, companies, governments, universities, etc. Fill in [this form](https://satoshipay.notion.site/Pendulum-Grant-Program-b38f44726d034e0bbe7286300f999df4) to apply.

## Benefits of a Pendulum Grant <a href="#e615" id="e615"></a>

## Projects we want to fund <a href="#id-1ff8" id="id-1ff8"></a>

We are interested in, but not limited to, funding ecosystem projects such as:

* **General purpose AMM:** Either a unique offering or a rewrite of one the popular open-source AMMs (Curve, Uniswap) in Wasm or as a Substrate pallet.
* **Lending protocol:** To provide safe, secure and sustainable avenues for fiat token holders to put their fiat tokens to work.
* **Stable fiat tokens:** Bring your stable fiat tokens to Pendulum or or build them on Pendulum itself. On/off ramping to the banking world is a big bonus.
* **Yield Optimizer:** A similar kind of yield optimizer to [yearn.finance](http://yean.finance/) and [beefy.finance](https://beefy.finance/) developing innovative yield earning strategies on Pendulum.
* **Decentralized Custodianship:** To work on solving the UX challenge of managing secret keys in a decentralized and trustless manner.
* **On/Off Ramps:** Reliable on/off ramps with regional banks.
* **Money-Streaming Service:** Similar to [Spritz Finance](https://www.spritz.finance/) supporting the payment of salaries and bills to anybody, anywhere on the globe.
