# Unlocking Vesting Tokens

In order to unlock tokens you have vested you will have to navigate to [polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts) under the Account tab.



On the far right side, if you have vested tokens, you will be able to unlock your vested tokens by clicking on the elypsis ( **â‹®** ) sign
