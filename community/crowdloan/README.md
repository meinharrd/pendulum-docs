# Crowdloan

Parachain slot crowdloans are a way for new projects to get their parachain on Polkadot and Kusama. To become a parachain, a project must first bid through an auction for a parachain slot.

In December 2022, Pendulum was [DotSamaâ€™s fastest crowdloan success ](https://medium.com/pendulum-chain/pendulum-wins-polkadot-parachain-in-3-minutes-dfc206ed01ce)with the 300,000 DOT (approximately $1.4M) hardcap being reached in 3 minutes.

In June 2022, [Amplitude](https://pendulumchain.org/amplitude) (Pendulum's sister network) won the Kusama [auction 42](https://medium.com/pendulum-chain/amplitude-wins-kusama-parachain-slot-80e07781ddbd) with more than 24,080 KSM (approximately $1,172,930) received.

**Pendulum & PEN**

Pendulum won auction 35 and our Polkadot parachain went live on Mainnet 14th February 2023.

A Polkadot crowdloan serves to trustlessly crowdsource DOT to bid on a parachain slot in Polkadot's parachain auctions. It is not exactly a loan, rather it is a way of locking your DOT tokens in order to vote for a parachain to successfully win a parachain slot in the network.
